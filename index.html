            Joanie. You're simply the best. You've always meant so much to me that it's sometimes tough to capture it into words. I hope you've been superduper, I hope you're excited about your real estate adventure, and I most importantly hope you're excited to wake up each and every day being the greatest Auntie the Earth has ever seen.

            Thank you so much for everything. For being there. For passing down life lessons. For being you.
