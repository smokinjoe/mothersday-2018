        Happy Mother's Day, Aka! I know things haven't always been easy for you - especially lately - but I wanted to know that I'm proud to have you as my grandmother. Whenever I think about the life you've lived, the adversity you have overcome <strong>and continue to overcome</strong>, it gives me strength. That even though my generation and me specifically, have our own challenges, if my grandmother was able to raise a family, watch her daughter thrive in a different country, watch as she raised two children of her own into the adults we currently are .. well, I can do it too, damn it. Because the strength you embody is the same strength that was passed down to me.
      </p>

        Thank you Aka. Thank you for everything. <a href="http://happymothersday.co/2018/words/">Here are some words that come to mind when I think of my mamas. Please enjoy!</a>
